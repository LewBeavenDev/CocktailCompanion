- As a new site user, I want to easily navigate throughout the site.

### **Returning site user's goals:**

- As a returning site user, I want to be able to Log in to my account.
- As a returning site user, I want to be able to upload my own recipes.
- As a returning site user, I want to be able to edit and delete those recipes.
- As a returning site user, I want to be able to view my uploaded drinks without seeing the recipe so I can revise the specs within the app.

### **Site owners goals:**

- As the site owner, I want the pre supplied recipes shown to everyone but for users to only have access to their own recipes.
- As the site owner, I want an admin account where I can periodically add new cocktails for everyone to see.
- As the site owner, I want the site fully responsive as mixologists and bartenders only have access to their phones behind a bar.
